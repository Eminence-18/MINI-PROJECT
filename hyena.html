            <h2>HYENA</h2>
            <p style="font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; font-size: x-large; ">There are two species of hyenas in Kenyathe striped hyena and the spotted hyena.
                They can be found throughout Africa, in all habitats except rainforests.
                
              <br><br>  The spotted hyena (also called the laughing hyena) is the largest hyena species, with the
                females being larger than the males. Their coats are patterned with dark spots. These
                
                animals hunt fish, birds, and even hippo calves, and can work in packs to take
                down wildebeests Or antelopes.
                
                <br><br>Striped hyenas are lesser known than their spotted cousins. They are more scavengers
                than hunters and typically come out at night t·ªç feed on carcasses left by other animals.
                
                The spotted hyena is listed by the IUCN as least concern, and the striped hyena is near
                threatened. Human-wildlife conflict is the main threat to their survival.</p>

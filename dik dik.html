                The dik-dik is a type of dwarf antelope that lives in arid regions of East Africa. They can
                live in such barren environments because they get water from the vegetation they eat.
              <br> <br> They also take cover in undergrowth to protect themselves from predators, including
                
                eagles and cats.
                
                There are four species of dik-diks, but just two of them live in Kenya. These include
                Guenther's dik-dik and Kirk's dik-dik. Kirk's is the largest dik-dik, though it's still small
                
                in comparison to other <br><br> It stands at just 45 centimetres (18 Inches) tall and
                weighs only 7.2 kilograms (15.8 pounds). Guenther 's dik-dik is smaller but has a longer
                
                snout.
                
                The IUCN lists both Kirk's dik-dik and Guenther's dik-dik as least concern, though they are
                hreatened by expanding agricultural settlements and excessive hunting in some areas.</p>

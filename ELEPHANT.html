            <h2>ELEPHANT</h2>
            <p style="font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; font-size: x-large; ">The African savannah elephant is the world's largest land mammal. It lives across many
                different habitats, including open savannahs, deserts, and forests. As these animals roam,
                they play an important role within their ecosystems. <br><br>They disperse seeds through their

                dung, helping to fertilise the land; they clear paths through vegetation and overgrown
                bush, promoting plant diversity; and they use their tusks and feet to access water in dry
                riverbeds, creating small watering holes for other animals to drink from.</br><br>

                African savannah elephants are found in 23 countries across Africa. They have large
                populations in Kenya, Botswana, Namibia, Tanzania, South Africa, Zambia, and
                Zimbabwe.

                The IUCN classifies the African savannah elephant as endangered. This means it is at a
                very high risk of extinction in the wild.<br><br> Their numbers are also decreasing. These
                clephants are poached for their ivory and their natural habitats are being converted into

                agricultual land and infrastructure by expanding human populations

            <h2>black-backed jackals</h2>
            <p style="font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;font-size: x-large;">
                The black-backed jackal is a member of the dog family. It has a rusty red coat with a
                black patch on its back and a black-tipped tail. It measures around 95 centimetres (37
                inches) from head to tail.
                
               <br><br> As opportunistic omnivores, jackals eat what they lan. They work in family packs to
                hunt small antelopes, but they`ll also feed on reptiles, insects, birds, fruits, berries, and
                carcasses left by larger predators.
                
                There are two distinct populations of black-backed jackals in Africa -one in East Africa,
                in countries including Kenya, Ethiopia, and Tanzania, and one in southern Africa, in
                countries including Namibia, Angola, and South Africa.
                
               <br><br> These animals live in a wide variety of habitats, from deserts to grasslands to savannahs.
                The IUCN lists black-backed jackals as least concem, meaning they face few threats.
                
                However, they are hunted by farmers who kill them to protect their livestock.</p>

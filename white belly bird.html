            <h2>White-bellied bird</h2>
            <p style="font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; font-size: x-large;">The white-bellied go-away bird has a call that sounds like 'go-way'. It has grey
                plumage, a white belly, and a huge crest on the top of its head. It also has white marks on
                
                its tail, which are visible when the bird is in flight.
                
              <br><br>  White-bellied go-away birds live in the arid savannahs and woodlands of Kenya,
                Tanzania, Uganda, Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, and Ethiopia. The IUCN lists this bird
                as least concern, with no major threats to its survival.</p>

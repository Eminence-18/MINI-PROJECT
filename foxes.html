            <h2>FOXES</h2>
            <p style="font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif; font-size: x-large; ">There are two species of foxes in Kenya: the bat-eared fox and the silver fox.
                Foxes are small to medium-sized animals that belong to the dog family. They are
                omnivores, feeding on small mammals, birds, and insects. Foxes are known for their
                intelligence and cunning nature.
                <br><br> The silver fox is a melanistic form of the red fox. It has black fur and is
                considered a rare species. The silver fox can be found in the forests of Kenya, where
                it feeds on small mammals, birds, and insects. The IUCN lists the silver fox as least
                concern and as having a stable population, though they are threatened by habitat loss
                and hunting.</p>

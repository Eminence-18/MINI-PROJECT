              The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classes cheetahs
              as vulnerable. This means the species is at high risk of extinction in the wild. There are
              just 6517 mature chectahs left in the wild, and their population is decreasing. Cheetahs are
              at a particular risk from habitat lose because they need such a large range.Most cheetahs live in unprotected areas, where they come into conflict with farmers.  </p>
